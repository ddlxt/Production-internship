# Setup Instructions

This repository contains multiple backend modules under `se-backend` and
now also includes the `gpt_academic` project. Use the `setup_envs.sh`
script to create a separate Python 3.12 virtual environment for each
module. Requirements listed in each module's `requirements.txt` (and the
one under `gpt_academic`) will be installed automatically.

```bash
bash setup_envs.sh
```

The script assumes `python3.12` is available on your system. After the
setup you can launch the academic assistant with:

```bash
cd gpt_academic && .venv/bin/python main.py
```

GPT Academic listens on port **8001** and exposes its UI under the
`/llms` path. The Vue frontend proxies this path so you can access the
assistant through `http://localhost:5173/llms` while keeping the main
frontend available at the root.
